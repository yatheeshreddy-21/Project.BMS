Local and Global variables :

01) Local Variable: A variable which is defined inside the function
                    is called Local Variale.

--> The Accessibility of local variable is limited only inside the 
    function, which means any local variable can not be accessed 
    outside the function.

02) Global Variable: A variable which is defined, outside the function
                     is called Global Variale.

--> The Accessibility of global variable can be done both inside and
    outside the function.

Example:

a=10
b=20
def func():
    x=90
    y=100
    print(x,y)  --> 90,100
    print(a,b)  --> 10,20

func()

print(a,b) --> 10,20
print(x,y) --> Error

In above example , 
the variable 'a' and 'b' are referred as Global variables and
the variable 'x' and 'y' are referred as local variables


global keyword :

It is used to convert any local variable as global variable before
it's declaration.

Syntax:  global var1,var2,......varn

Ex: global x
    global x,y,z

--> global keyword should be declared inside the function.
--> global keyword should be done before declaring values to variables.
Ex:01)

def func():
    global x,y
    x=90
    y=100
    print(x,y)                 output: 90 100
                                       90 100
func()
print(x,y)

Ex:02)

a=10
def fun():
    global a                  output: 30
    a+=20                             30
    print(a)
fun()
print(a)
