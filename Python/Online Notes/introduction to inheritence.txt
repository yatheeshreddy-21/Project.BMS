INHERITENCE:

The process of deriving the properties from One class to another class
is called as Inheritence.

Advantages:

01) We can avoid code repetition
02) We can reduce number of lines of code
03) Therefore Time taken for execution of programm will be less
04) Hence, We can increase the efficiency of code.


Parent/Super/Base class  : The class from which the properties are being
                           derived is called a parent class.

Child/Sub/Derived class  : The class to which the properties are being
                           derived is called a child class.

There are 5 types of Inheritence in python :

1) Single level inheritence
2) Multi level inheritence
3) Multiple inheritence
4) Hierarchial inheritence
5) Hybrid inheritence
