PACKING :

--> It is a process of combining the individual data items or values
    into a collection.

There are two types in packing :

1) Single packing
2) Double packing

1) Single packing :

--> It is a process of combining the positional arguments with the help
    of *args

--> by default ,It combines the values in the form of tuple,hence it is also known
    as tuple packing.

Example: 

def display(*args):
    print(args)

display(10,2.5,'hi',99.99)
   

#output  :  (10, 2.5, 'hi', 99.99)

2) Double packing :

--> It is a process of combining the keyword arguments with the help
    of **kwargs.

--> by default, It combines the values in the form of dictionary,hence it is also
    known as dictionary packing.

Example:

def display(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)

display(a=10,b=2.5,c='hi',d=99.99)
  
#output  :  {'a': 10, 'b': 2.5, 'c': 'hi', 'd': 99.99}
