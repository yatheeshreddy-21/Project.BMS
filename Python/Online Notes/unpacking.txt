UNPACKING :

--> The process of seperating each and every value of the given
    collection or sequence is called as unpacking,

--> Unpacking can be done in 3 ways :

1) Using indexing
2) Using syntax
3) For user defined functions

1) Using indexing :

Example:

p=[1,2,3]
a=p[0]
a
1
b=p[1]
b
2
c=p[2]
c
3

--> Since we can perform indexing only on collections which are
    supporting indexing(set and dictionary will not support indexing)

--> Therefore to overcome this problem we are moving to second way

2) Using syntax:

Syntax :  var1,var2....varn = collection 

--> In this method the number of variables must be equal to the number of values 
    ina collection.

--> This method supports for set and dictionary also but in the case of set
    random value will be unpacked.

Example:

p,q,r={4,16,9}
p
16
q
9
r
4

a,b,c='god'
a
'g'
b
'o'
c
'd'

a,b,c,d=range(1,5)
a
1
b
2
c
3
d
4

3) For user defined functions:

--> In an user defined function the unpacking can be done at the time of 
    function call using '*' along with the collection.

--> Where number of formal arguments should be equal to length of collection
    present at actual argument section.

Example:01

L=[10,20,30]

def unpack(a,b,c):
    print(a+b+c)

#unpack(*L)                    ----->  o/p = 60

#unpack(*[10,20,30])           ----->  o/p = 60

#unpack(*range(10,31,10))      ----->  o/p = 60

#unpack(L[0],L[1],L[2])        ----->  o/p = 60


Example:02

def display(x,y,z):
    print(x,y,z)

display(*{'hi':10,5:777,'day':'night'})       ----->  o/p = hi 5 day
